Welcome to the Hospital Management System - Admin Panel project! This is a full-stack web application designed to simplify hospital operations by providing an intuitive interface for administrative tasks such as managing patient records, appointments, admissions, staff, and more.

🚀 Project Overview:
This project was a learning journey to sharpen my frontend skills and responsive design abilities, as well as learning backend development. Over the course of 4 months, I developed it into a full-stack system using React.js, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.

Along the way, I enhanced my understanding and practical skills in:
Frontend development: Building responsive and user-friendly interfaces with React and custom CSS
State management: Implementing Redux to efficiently manage global state, especially for dynamic dashboard components
Backend development: Creating RESTful APIs with Node and Express, and designing relational data schemas in PostgreSQL
User authentication: Implementing secure admin login and session handling
Database design: Implementing complex business rules, triggers, and constraints in PostgreSQL to maintain data integrity and automate processes

🔧 Technologies Used:
Frontend:
React.js
Redux (for state management)
CSS3 (custom styling)
Axios (for API calls)

Backend:
Node.js
Express.js
PostgreSQL (including triggers and constraints)

🎯 Features Implemented:
Admin authentication (basic setup)
Dynamic dashboard with live updates using Redux
Patient, doctor, staff, room, appointment, and admission management (CRUD)
Medical records management for each patient
Automated triggers for payment statuses based on amounts paid
Business logic triggers such as changing room status upon occupation
Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
Error handling and form validation
Integration of backend API with frontend component

🌱 Learning Outcomes:
Bridged frontend and backend development through API integration
Mastered state management patterns with Redux in real-world applications
Improved responsive UI design skills for diverse screen sizes
Gained experience implementing secure user authentication
Designed and implemented complex database logic with PostgreSQL triggers and constraints to enforce business rules

🔮 Future Plans:
Although this project is functionally complete, I plan to return and enhance it by:
Implementing role-based authentication with multiple user types (doctors, receptionists, admins)
Building personalized dashboards for different user roles

📌 Final Notes
This project was a significant step in my growth as a full-stack developer. Given that I was learning as I built, the extended timeline of 4 months allowed me to deeply understand each layer of the stack. I'm excited to keep improving it and apply these skills in future projects
